//  This app calculates all the combinations of choosing a team of size M from candidates list of N potentials
//  Each person has one other person they like and two people they dislike
//  Likes are mutual, dislikes are not
//  Goal is to have the largest group where no one is "unhappy", i.e. no more person within the team has more people they dislike than like.
//
//  Using Metthew Belmonte's twiddle code, we create N choose M combinations, and check each to calculate the team happiness.

#include <stdio.h>

/*twiddle.c - generate all combinations of M elements drawn without replacement
 from a set of N elements.  This routine may be used in two ways:
 (0) To generate all combinations of M out of N objects, let a[0..N-1]
 contain the objects, and let c[0..M-1] initially be the combination
 a[N-M..N-1].  While twiddle(&x, &y, &z, p) is false, set c[z] = a[x] to
 produce a new combination.
 (1) To generate all sequences of 0's and 1's containing M 1's, let
 b[0..N-M-1] = 0 and b[N-M..N-1] = 1.  While twiddle(&x, &y, &z, p) is
 false, set b[x] = 1 and b[y] = 0 to produce a new sequence.
 In either of these cases, the array p[0..N+1] should be initialised as
 follows:
 p[0] = N+1
 p[1..N-M] = 0
 p[N-M+1..N] = 1..M
 p[N+1] = -2
 if M=0 then p[1] = 1
 In this implementation, this initialisation is accomplished by calling
 inittwiddle(M, N, p), where p points to an array of N+2 ints.
